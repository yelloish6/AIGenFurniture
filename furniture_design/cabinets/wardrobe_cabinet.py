'''
WardrobeCabinet is a subclass of BaseCabinet, inheriting its attributes and methods.
The __init__ method adds specific attributes for a wardrobe cabinet (e.g., has_mirror, has_drawers).
The display_summary method is overridden to include wardrobe-specific information.
The generate_manufacturing_files method is overridden to include additional logic for manufacturing files specific to 
a wardrobe cabinet. It calls the base class method for common manufacturing file generation and adds wardrobe-specific 
file generation logic.
Make sure to adjust the attributes and methods according to your specific requirements for a wardrobe cabinet. 
Also, consider adding additional validation or error handling as needed.
